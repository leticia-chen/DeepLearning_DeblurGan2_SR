# DeepLearning_DeblurGan2_SR
The objective of this project is to improve the quality of motion blurred images using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). After discovering the effectiveness of the DeblurGAN-v2 in motion deblurring, we have noticed that the resulting images still lack clarity. Therefore, we propose to preprocess our dataset, consisting of GPRO images, with the DeblurGAN-v2 to remove motion blur. We will then utilize the SR GAN technique to further enhance the quality of the images and generate clearer and more detailed results. The goal of this project is to provide a more effective solution for motion deblurring, with the potential for application in various domains such as photography and video processing.
